In this project, created a program that creates a sorted list from a data file.  The program prompts the user for the name of the data file. 

I created a class obkect called 'person' that contains a First Name, Last Name, and Age. The main() function declares an array of up to 20 person objects, and loads each line from the input file into an object in the array.

This project was for my introduction to programming II class at university. Using my knowledge from class, I implemented the necessary algorithms/code. I also used my course materials (lecture slides and textbooks) and advice from the professor.

The program does the following: 
•	Prompts the user for the name of the file
•	Opens the file
•	Reads the data into the array of person objects (maximum size 20)
•	Closes the file
•	Sorts the array
•	Displays the array
